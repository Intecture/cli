# Contributing to Intecture

Woo hoo! I always had a good feeling about you. Your contributions are most welcome. Thanks so much in advance for your hard work!

## Contributing

You can make contributions to Intecture via GitHub pull requests. All levels of expertise are welcome.

#### No, you're a git!

If, upon reading this, you find yourself reconsidering that career move to landscape gardening, first take a look at the [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) model and GitHub's [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/about-pull-requests/) docs. They're aimed at beginners and will hopefully demystify the contribution process. For motivation, try to picture that great day when you can order your custom-printed "Cut bugs, not grass!" t-shirt.

## Help and feedback

Carl Sagan once said "There is no such thing as a dumb question".
