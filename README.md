## System Requirements

Intecture relies on [ZeroMQ](http://zeromq.org) for communication between your project and your managed hosts. The Intecture installer will install these dependencies automatically, however if you are building Intecture manually, you will need to install ZeroMQ and CZMQ before proceeding.

## Install

The best way to get up and running is by using the Intecture installer:

```
$ curl -sSf https://get.intecture.io/ | sh -s -- cli
```

## Uninstall

If you used the Intecture installer to install the CLI, you can also use it for removal:

```
$ curl -sSf https://get.intecture.io/ | sh -s -- -u cli
```
